<h2>More about our Cookies</h2>

<ul>
</ul>

<p>There is no way to prevent these cookies being set other than to not use our site.</p>

<ul>
                                                                      </ul>

<p>Disabling these cookies will likely break the functions offered by these third parties</p>

<ul>
</ul>

<p>It may be that you concerns around cookies relate to so called "spyware". Rather than switching off cookies in your browser you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive.  .</p>

<p>Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something that you aren't sure whether you need or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with one of the features you use on our site.
